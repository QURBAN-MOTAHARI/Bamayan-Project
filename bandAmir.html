            to end of August, while the cold weather runs the entire times of the year, 
            with frozen lakes capped with huge snow. It is said that Bandi Amir is one 
            of its only seven kinds in the world, due to its sky-blue waters and 
            naturally made thin-walls from live limestones that reserve the waters in 7 separate 
            small bodies of water. The water for thelakesmainly originates from natural springs, 
            located at an altitude of 3000 meters above sea level, mixing with rain-water and snow melts, 
            finally pouring into the lakes that are at about 2600 meters above sea level, 
            respectively.
