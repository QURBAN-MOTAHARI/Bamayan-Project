        Bamiyan is a basin located in a long ravine which runs East to West. 
        In the North there are the Koh-e KhwahaGhar mountains which are an offset of the 
        Hindukush mountain range. In the South lie the Koh-e Baba mountains. The best season 
        to visit Bamiyan is from April to October. Various beautiful flowers are in bloom and a 
        variety of alpine plant can be seen in June. The row of poplars turn yellow in October and 
        the leaves start to fall in the following month. The beginning of Winter starts in November 
        when the snow falls in Bamiyan. Bamiyan was an important ancient caravan city which 
        flourished during the days of the Silk Road. Many caravans from the East and the West 
        passed through the city of Bamiyan during their journey on the Silk Road. The road from 
        Bamiyan leads to Balkh in the North, Ghazni and Kandahar in the South, Kabul and Jalalabad 
        in the East and Herat in the West. The merchants in the days of Buddhism came to Bamiyan to 
        worship and make offerings at the temples with prayers for the safety of their journey. 
        Although the two Giant Buddhas of Bamiyan, which were a wonderful representation of the 
        cultural heritage of the luxury and fortune of the ancient Buddhist period, they were 
        tragically destroyed by the Taliban, which was the previous government in 
        Afghanistan in 2001. Bamiyan also has many other interesting places to explore, 
        besides the Buddhist ruins. There are remains of Islamic, medieval period, and also the 
        beautiful nature of the valleys including Lake Pand: Band-i-Amir. Admission tickets are 
        necessary to get into these three places: Bamiyan caves, Shahr-i-Zohak and Shahr-i-Gholgora. 
        Tickets are available at the office near the West Giant Buddha. US$7(300Afs) for one day 
        ticket is valid for all three places. If you want to visit on different days you have to 
        purchase a ticket again.

        Bamiyan valley, which sits in the lap of the towering Hindu Kush mountains, 
        about 180km north-west of Kabul, is among the most breathtakingly beautiful areas 
        in Afghanistan. It is also considered one of the most peaceful regions in the war-ridden country. 
        Its history dates back more than 2,000 years, and its archaeological heritage is a confluence of 
        Persian, Turkish, Greek and Chinese cultures. In 2003, Unesco listed the “cultural landscape and 
        archaeological remains of the Bamiyan valley" on its World Heritage List and the List of World 
        Heritage in Danger, two years after the Taliban had blown up the sixth century Buddha sculptures 
        that were Bamiyan’s biggest attraction. And in June, it was officially declared the first ever 
        “Saarc capital of culture", for the year 2015-16—Saarc stands for South Asian Association for 
        Regional Cooperation. A series of cultural and sports events have been planned throughout the 
        year; all the Saarc countries are taking part.
